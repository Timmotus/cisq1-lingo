# Vulnerability Analysis

## A1:2017 Injection

### Description

Almost any source of data can be an injection vector. Injection can result in data loss, corruption, or disclosure to unauthorized parties, loss of accountability, or denial of access. Injection can sometimes lead to complete host takeover.

### Risk

The risk of SQL injection happening in the project is large considering we get user input data from pathvariables and parameters. Authentication or authorization would not help in this project as the input could still be unsanitized.

### Counter-measures

This project uses JpaRepository's which implementations are generated by Spring. The generated implementation uses parameterized input, which prevents an SQL injection.

## A4:2017 XML External Entities (XXE)

### Description

Attackers can exploit vulnerable XML processors if they can upload XML or include hostile content in an XML document, exploiting vulnerable code, dependencies or integrations. These flaws can be used to extract data, execute a remote request from the server, scan internal systems, perform a denial-of-service attack, as well as execute other attacks.

### Risk

The risk of XML External Entities is non existant as the project does not accept XML input. Authentication or authorization would not impact this.

### Counter-measures

This project accepts JSON where input bodies are required instead of XML, which prevents XXE from being a risk.

## A9:2017 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

### Description

Using dependencies/components which have known vulnerabilities. While some known vulnerabilities lead to only minor impacts, some of the largest breaches to date have relied on exploiting known vulnerabilities in components.

### Risk

This project uses a fair number of dependencies, so the vulnerability is high. Authentication or authorization would introduce mor vulnerabilities as those would likely too have to be dependencies on for example Spring-Security.

### Counter-measures

The dependencies get checked by a plugin with every test/verify of the project. Dependabot has also been setup on the Github repository of this project to periodically check for vulnerabilities.
